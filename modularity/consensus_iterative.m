function [S2, Q2, X_new3, qpc] = consensus_iterative(C)
%CONSENSUS_ITERATIVE     Construct a consensus (representative) partition
%using the iterative thresholding procedure
%
%   [S2 Q2 X_new3 qpc] = CONSENSUS_ITERATIVE(C) identifies a single
%   representative partition from a set of C partitions, based on
%   statistical testing in comparison to a null model. A thresholded nodal
%   association matrix is obtained by subtracting a random nodal
%   association matrix (null model) from the original matrix. The
%   representative partition is then obtained by using a Generalized
%   Louvain algorithm with the thresholded nodal association matrix.
