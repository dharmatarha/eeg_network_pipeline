# Eeg_network_pipeline
Functions for network discovery and comparison in EEG data.

The aim of the repo is to collect the Matlab scripts/functions used in the **Sound and speech perception Research Group** at TTK (PI: Istvan Winkler) for network-based analyses of EEG data. We assume that data is already preprocessed (e.g. re-referenced, filtered for muscle and other artefacts, bandpass filtered to ranges of interest, reconstructed into source-space). Main analysis steps include: 

(1) connectivity measurements; 
(2) edge pruning and other network discovery/construction methods; 
(4) clustering / modularity / other network structure discovery methods; 
(5) network similarity measures / network comparisons.

Functions are grouped according to the above classification
