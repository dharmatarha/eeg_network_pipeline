# Eeg_network_pipeline
Functions for network discovery and comparison in EEG data.

The aim of the repo is to collect the Matlab scripts/functions used for network-based analyses of EEG data in the **Sound and Speech Perception Research Group** at TTK, Budapest (PI: Istvan Winkler). We assume that data is already preprocessed (e.g. re-referenced, filtered for muscle and other artefacts, bandpass filtered to ranges of interest, reconstructed into source-space). Main analysis steps include: 

1. **Connectivity measurements;**
2. **Edge pruning and other network discovery/construction methods;**
3. **Clustering / modularity / other network structure discovery methods;** 
4. **Network similarity measures / network comparisons.**

Functions are grouped according to the above classification.
